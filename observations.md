## Observation 1
Latitude and Max Temperature are correllated. The closer to the equator (Latitude = 0) the higher
the Max Temperature

## Observation 2
Humidity v Latitude has a very small r-squared in the Northern Hemisphere 0.0032 and Southern
Hemisphere 0.000039. This shows that there is very little correlation between Latitude and Humidity

## Observation 3
Wind Speed is not normally distributed with a Standard Deviation of 5.29 and a Mean of 7.68. The
50th Percentile is 6.42 and the Max Wind speed is 27.54. This indicates the Max Wind Speed is
very impactful and possibly an outlier
